# Session notes

- If an upcoming action risks hitting a platform/tool limit (e.g. request size
  caps like the ~32MB upload limit, rate limits, context limits), flag it to
  the user *before* it causes a failure — don't let them discover it via an
  opaque error after the fact. If a limit is already close, say so and suggest
  a workaround (e.g. send fewer/smaller images per message) up front.
